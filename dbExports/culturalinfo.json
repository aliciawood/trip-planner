Other popular attractions and sights in Florida include world-famous amusement parks like Disney, Universal Studios and SeaWorld, historical St. Augustine, the Everglades and the Florida Keys.

Examples of Mississippi cooking include barbecue, biscuits and gravy, gumbo, fried chicken, shrimp and grits, po’ boys, fried catfish (Mississippi is one of the world’s biggest producers of catfish) and other hearty – maybe not healthy – home-cooked meals. For barbecue, try The Shed Barbeque and Blues Joint in Ocean Springs or Gulfport, or get a taste for traditional Southern dining and old-fashioned milkshakes at Triplett-Day Drug Co., where a diner is tucked away in the back of a pharmacy.

Cabins and camping are also available in the area. Food One of the best ways to experience cultural exchange is through food and cooking. Visitors will enjoy exploring the regional specialties and local cuisine during their time in the United States. Wisconsin may be best known for its cheese, but there is more to the state’s cuisine than dairy products. Food in Wisconsin is largely influenced by its cultural heritage, which includes immigrant groups from England, Germany, Norway, Poland, Greece, Italy, Ireland and other European countries. More recently, immigrants from East Asia (especially Hmong refuges), the Caribbean and Latin America have added to the cultural heritage of Wisconsin. Today, visitors will find Wisconsin specialties and local produce like bratwurst, morels, a fish fry and frozen custard alongside ethnic restaurants throughout the state.
